# Vercel Web Analytics Implementation

Successfully implemented Vercel Web Analytics for the React + Vite project.

## Changes Made

### 1. Installed Dependencies
- Added `@vercel/analytics` package (v1.6.1) to the project dependencies

### 2. Modified Files

#### `src/App.tsx`
- Added import: `import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/react";`
- Added `<Analytics />` component at the end of the main app div, after the `<Routes>` component
- This integration provides seamless analytics tracking with automatic route detection for React Router

#### `package.json`
- Added `@vercel/analytics` to dependencies

#### `package-lock.json`
- Updated with new dependency and its transitive dependencies

## Implementation Details

The Analytics component was added to the main App component following the official Vercel Web Analytics guide for React applications. This implementation:

- Uses the React-specific wrapper (`@vercel/analytics/react`) for optimal integration
- Automatically tracks page views and navigation events
- Works seamlessly with React Router (which this project uses)
- Will start tracking visitors after deployment to Vercel

## Testing

- ✅ Build completed successfully with `npm run build`
- ✅ No new linting errors introduced in modified files
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passed without errors

## Next Steps

To complete the setup:
1. Deploy the application to Vercel
2. Enable Web Analytics in the Vercel dashboard (Project → Analytics → Enable)
3. After deployment, analytics data will be available at `/_vercel/insights/*` routes
4. View analytics data in the Vercel dashboard under the Analytics tab

## Notes

The implementation preserves all existing code structure and functionality. The Analytics component is non-invasive and only adds tracking capabilities without affecting the app's behavior.
